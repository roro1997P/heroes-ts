I Hope this MD find you well.
This application is a refactor of one of my initial projects.

- Is required a google account to login into the app (only your public information is used, like your email and name).
- The session expiration depends on your google account. In my case expires in 30 minutes.
- Is my second time using typescript with vue, and if there any tip or fix wich I can do please, let me know.

## Install the dependencies
```bash
yarn
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
yarn dev
```

### Build the app for production
```bash
yarn build
```
